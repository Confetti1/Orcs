Finish implementing orcs (to see if I can)
Add additional races, backstories (race specific and otherwise), and factions for: 
  -Elves 
  -Halflings 
  -Gnomes 
  -Dwarves 
  -Goblins?
Add new Pathfinder-based weapons to allow a more medieval-focused run possible
  -Greatswords
  -Battleaxes
  -Crossbows
Add Pathfinder-based monsters and creatures to appear in the wild, and possibly also add mysterious fey.
  -Goblin Dogs
  -Wollipeds
  -Trolls?
