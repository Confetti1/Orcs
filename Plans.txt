Finish implementing orcs (to see if it's possible) (I'm almost there I swear)
Add additional races, backstories (race specific and otherwise), and factions for: 
  -Elves 
  -Halflings 
  -Gnomes 
  -Dwarves 
  -Goblins?
Add new Pathfinder-based weapons to allow a more medieval-focused run possible
  -Greatswords
  -Battleaxes
  -Crossbows
  -Muskets
  -Flintlocks
  -Double Hackbut
  -Shield pistol/tamohawk pistol?
  
-------POSSIBLE/STRETCH THINGS-------
Add new Pathfinder-based siege weapons and defenses
  -Ballistae (Like an autocannon that needs to be manned)
  -Catapult (similar to mortars)
  -Cannon (With possible ammunition options)
Add Pathfinder-based monsters and creatures to appear in the wild, and possibly also add mysterious fey.
  -Goblin Dogs
  -Wollipeds
  -Trolls?
Add Pathfinder-based ores and materials
  -Adamantine (Ignores armor, improves defense by a lot)
  -Mithril (Weapons attack faster? Decrease movement speed penalty in armor)
