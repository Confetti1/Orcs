Add additional races, backstories (race specific and otherwise), and factions for: 
  -Elves 
    -Better shooters, faster research
  -Halflings 
    -Better growers, (something to represent sneakiness?), Somehow give mood bonuses to nearby colonists (or some other way to represent luck?)
  -Gnomes 
    -Get Koroblin to make some custom hairs, find out if hairs automatically adjust to head shap
    -Add custom tinker-type researches/craft projects that only gnomes can make. (Limber Leg, clockwork limbs)
  -Dwarves 
    -Inherent mining bonus, maybe yield more ore while mining? Custom Hediff for extra bonuses from drinking alcohol.
    -Custom dwarven-themed ale that gives big benefits to Dwarves, but more penalties to others?
    -Dwarven themed weapons?
  -Goblins
    -Incredibly weak, but large in numbers. Have silly names.
    -Goblin themed weapons
  -Tieflings
    -Use tiefling heritages as child backstories
    -See what customization I can get away with based on the backstories (different skin colors, maybe even horn shapes from tiefling.)
    
Add new Pathfinder-based weapons to allow a more medieval-focused run possible
  -Greatswords
  -Battleaxes
  -Crossbows
  -Muskets
  -Flintlocks
  -Double Hackbut

-------POSSIBLE/STRETCH THINGS-------
Add new Pathfinder-based siege weapons and defenses

Add Pathfinder-based monsters and creatures to appear in the wild, and possibly also add mysterious fey.
  -Goblin Dogs
  -Wollipeds
