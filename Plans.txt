TO DO:
-Adjust price values of goblin weapons
-slightly lessen the range of crossbows
-Fix kingdom pawnkinds having little/no clothes
-fix Vee gnome hairstyle
-Fix wondrous workshop not working
-Need more elf hairs
-Need more dwarf hairs
-Halflings have not been implemented yet
-Customize the kingdom more, custom trade
-Add goblin torch weapons
-Fix up the faction colors to be less samey
-Add "secret" factions, similar to mechanoids, for forces of nature (Demon attacks, maybe trolls and stuff)
-Add unicorns and sparkly nice-looking object for Kat
-Add Pesh, the halucinogenic. See if I can get it to thrive in deserts/hot areas, and not much else. 
Add additional races, backstories (race specific and otherwise), and factions for: 
  -Elves 
    -Better shooters, faster research
  -Halflings 
    -Better growers, (something to represent sneakiness?), Somehow give mood bonuses to nearby colonists (or some other way to represent luck?)
  -Gnomes 
    -Add custom tinker-type researches/craft projects that only gnomes can make. (Limber Leg, clockwork limbs)
  -Dwarves 
    -Inherent mining bonus, maybe yield more ore while mining? Custom Hediff for extra bonuses from drinking alcohol.
    -Custom dwarven-themed ale that gives big benefits to Dwarves, but more penalties to others?
    -Dwarven themed weapons?
    -Digging drill-like production station, but it gives random stone chunks and minerals. 
  -Goblins
    -Add Barghests to be the chief of goblins, add Goblin Dogs to aid in goblin raids. 
  -Tieflings
    -Use tiefling heritages as child backstories
    -See what customization I can get away with based on the backstories (different skin colors, maybe even horn shapes from tiefling.)
    
Add new Pathfinder-based weapons to allow a more medieval-focused run possible
  -Greatswords
  -Muskets
  -Flintlocks
  -Double Hackbut
  -Shield pistol/tamohawk pistol?

Add magic-crafting, where gold is used to create magical items, like:
  -Continual Flame (Special torch/ballista thing that never needs to be refueled, and creates no heat.)
  -Orb of Neutrality (Raises temp if cold, lowers temp if hot. Strives for 21 degrees C.)
  -Weapons +1 (If I can figure out a way to enhance normal weapons, then that would be awesome)
  -Armor +1 (Same as above)
  -Ring of Protection (Give a slight armor bonus to all body parts)
  -Bracers of Archery (Increase sight)
  -Boots of Speed (Base speed increase, unless I can figure out a way to make them activatable once per day)
  -Belt of Cat's Grace/Bull's Strength
  -Headband of Alluring Charisma (Increases social factor/Talking functionality)
  -Wands (Objects that can only be used a certain amount of times to achieve magical effects)
    -Fireball
    -Sleep (Custom heDiff that makes consciousness to 0)
    -Calm Emotions (Gives the user/target a sizeable psychic calm)
    -Shield or Mage Armor (Custom heDiff that increases armor while active, perhaps?)
    -Cat's Grace/Bull's Strength (Maybe just cat's grace to increase manipulation)
    -Magic Missile (Three or four missiles that do low damage, but never miss)
    -Scorching Ray (Three fiery bolts that do high damage)
  -Bag of Holding (Storage space for a large amount of things, possibly? Maybe not depending on coding difficulty)
  -Animated Crossbow Turret (Automatically aims and shoots)
  
Add bookmaking (Way to make paper from wood, use paper and cloth to make books)
  -Used to make bookshelves, which has high beauty. It also increases the speed
  
-------POSSIBLE/STRETCH THINGS-------
Add new Pathfinder-based siege weapons and defenses
  -Catapult (similar to mortars)
  -Cannon (With possible ammunition options)
Add Pathfinder-based monsters and creatures to appear in the wild, and possibly also add mysterious fey.
  -Wollipeds
  -Trolls?
Add Pathfinder-based ores and materials
  -Adamantine (Ignores armor, improves defense by a lot)
  -Mithril (Weapons attack faster? Decrease movement speed penalty in armor)
